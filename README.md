## Project Purpose and Functionality

FinTrack integrates various technologies to deliver a comprehensive personal finance management solution:

- **Backend**: Built with Python and Flask, FinTrack manages user data and financial transactions securely.
- **Database**: SQLite is used to store and retrieve financial data efficiently.
- **Frontend**: Developed with React, the frontend provides an interactive dashboard for users to visualize their financial information.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
- The backend server uses SQLite as its database to store financial data.
- The React frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and display financial information.
- Users can track expenses, set budgets, and analyze spending habits through intuitive interfaces.

## Features

- Track expenses and income with detailed categorization.
- Set budget goals and receive notifications for exceeding limits.
- Generate reports and graphs to analyze spending trends over time.
- Secure user authentication and data privacy controls.
